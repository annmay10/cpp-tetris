#### Final Project proposal : Tetris

CS 126 - Spring 2020

# Project Overview

I propose to implement and design a recreation of the classic game Tetris. The game will follow classic tetris rules. I will also implement a database to store the highest scores. The game will be implemented using cinder, and its many extensions. I might also use certain other cpp extensions to draw the necessary tiles. 

# Personal Background

I have been an avid fan of the game tetris for a long time now. From following the world championships every year to playing the game myself, I have been heavily involved in the world of tetris and its new developments. Seeing how the game evolves everyday, I have chosen this game as it gives me the flexibility to maintain the classic design whilst trying to implement newer features that have been introduced in the modern games. As the snake assignment has given me an idea into using graphics and audio, the first idea that came into my mind was to try to implement tetris myself

# External Libraries

I will mostly implement cinder and use its extensions for the graphics and audio.
However, an alternate might be the graphics.h library of cpp or the sfml grahpics library - https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1126/materials/cppdoc/graphics.html

Similar to the snake project, I will be using a database to store and display the highest scores -

# Stretch Goals 

The following features represent functionality that we will prioritize after our baseline of functionality is complete:

Try to implement a server or a multiplayer feature to allow two or more players to play simultaneously in a format similar to ‘tetris with friends’

Try to add a hold and a window which shows the next block that will arrive.

Try to add items to the game which could have different functionalities.

# Timeline

### Week 1

- Design the tiles and load image files if needed

- Implement background audio

- Set up initial database for high-scores

- Set up keys and functionality to move the blocks

### Week 2 

- Implement the hard-drop functionality and functionality to clear a tetris

- Implement audio for a tetris

- Making extra levels as the user progresses to increase difficulty and the speed with which the blocks drop (also increase the speed of the background music)

### Week 3

- Polish up the code

- Implement high-score tables

- Implement a menu
